# Provision Infrastructure Resources Using Fleet Application Management

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to define and provision infrastructure resources such as Compute, Networking, and Storage using Fleet Application Management. You will learn how to use Catalog Items, Runbooks, and Fleets to organize resources and streamline infrastructure provisioning workflows.

Estimated Time: 30 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Create private Catalog Items for Terraform configurations and parameters
* Build a Runbook by adding Catalog Items as tasks to define provisioning steps
* Create a Fleet to organize resources
* Execute the Runbook on the Fleet and monitor the deployment

### Prerequisites

* This lab requires completion of the Get Started section in the Contents menu on the left.

## Task 1: Create a Private Terraform Catalog Item

(optional) Task 1 opening paragraph.

## Task 2: Create a Private Configuration Catalog Item

1. Step 1 - tables sample

  Use tables sparingly:

  | Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | 1 | Some text or a link | More text  |
  | 2 |Some text or a link | More text |
  | 3 | Some text or a link | More text |

2. You can also include bulleted lists - make sure to indent 4 spaces:

    - List item 1
    - List item 2

3. Code examples

    ```
    Adding code examples
  	Indentation is important for the code example to appear inside the step
    Multiple lines of code
  	<copy>Enclose the text you want to copy in <copy></copy>.</copy>
    ```

4. Code examples that include variables

	```
  <copy>ssh -i <ssh-key-file></copy>
  ```

## Task 3: Build a Runbook and Add Catalog Items as Tasks

## Task 4: Create a Fleet Without Resources

## Task 5: Execute the Runbook on the Fleet

## Task 6: Monitor Deployments and Provisioned Resources
