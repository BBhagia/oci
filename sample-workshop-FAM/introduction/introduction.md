# Introduction

## About this Workshop

As organizations scale their presence on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), managing patching, provisioning, and compliance across a diverse set of resources becomes increasingly complex. OCI Fleet Application Management solves this challenge by providing a centralized platform to automate and govern cloud operations at scale, reducing manual effort while improving consistency and security. This workshop explores how enterprises can streamline infrastructure provisioning, apply patches to multi-tier applications like Oracle Fusion Middleware, and maintain compliance for both Oracle and third-party software. By leveraging resource grouping and policy-driven automation, participants will gain a practical path to operational efficiency across their entire OCI environment.
